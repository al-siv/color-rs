# NCS Research Plan

Status: Draft
Date: 2025-08-13

## Objective
Assess feasibility of integrating NCS Index 2050 colors into color-rs while respecting licensing and data accuracy constraints.

## Tasks
1. Source Identification
   - Locate authoritative NCS dataset (public vs licensed)
   - Determine data fields: notation, sRGB approximation, Lab, description
2. Licensing & Compliance
   - Confirm redistribution rights
   - If proprietary, outline fallback: user-supplied CSV import path
3. Data Quality & Mapping
   - Evaluate conversion accuracy from available representations to Lab
   - Define tolerance thresholds vs published references
4. Data Model Integration
   - Extend `ColorCollectionKind` with `Ncs` (gated behind feature flag to preserve F5 invariants when absent)
   - Add loader/parsing similar to existing RAL loaders
5. Performance & Size Impact
   - Estimate added memory footprint (entries * struct size)
   - Benchmark lookup & distance operations
6. Risk & Mitigation
   - Licensing risk: mitigate via optional feature + user data import
   - Accuracy risk: add validation harness comparing sample known values
7. Rollout Plan
   - Phase 1: Research + prototype loader
   - Phase 2: Validation tests + performance benchmarks
   - Phase 3: Documentation & CLI exposure

## Open Questions
- Are official Lab coordinates published or only NCS notations requiring conversion?
- Acceptable delta E variance threshold (<2.0?) for approximations.

## Next Steps
- Perform licensing survey and record findings in follow-up report.
